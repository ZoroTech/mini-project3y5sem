## Default Teacher Accounts

The system comes with two pre-configured teacher accounts:

   - Password: 12345678

2. **Prof. Priya Sharma**
   - Email: teacher2@pvppcoe.ac.in

## Project Domains (Auto-assigned)

The system randomly assigns one of the following domains to each project:

- 🤖 AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning)

## Similarity Score

Each project receives a similarity score (0-100%) that represents how similar the project is to existing projects in the database.

**Current Implementation:** Randomly generated dummy data (50-100%)

**Future Enhancement:** Connect to ML model for real similarity analysis
